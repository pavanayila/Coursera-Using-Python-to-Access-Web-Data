              mysock.connect(('data.pr4e.org', 80))
              cmd = 'GET http://data.pr4e.org/romeo.txt HTTP/1.0\n\n'.encode()
              mysock.send(cmd)

              while True:
                  data = mysock.recv(512)
                  if (len(data) < 1):
                      break
                  print(data.decode())
